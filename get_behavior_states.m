function [states,stateseq] = get_behavior_states(bouts,tvec)
% get_behavior_states
%   This function takes as input the bouts and timestamp vector for one
%   session and returns 2 representations of the state sequence of the
%   animal. For a session with n solutions, there are n+1 possible states.
%   Sampling at the n solutions represents n of the states and the last
%   state represents the animal not sampling any of the solutions (the
%   animal is 'wandering')
%
%   Inputs:
%       bouts - cell array of struct arrays of length # of solutions
%
%       tvec - vector of timestamps for each timestep
%
%   Outpus:
%       states - (n+1)x36000 matrix where each column has one entry that is
%                1 indicating the animal is in that state
%
%       stateseq - vector of length 36000 where each entry gives the state
%                  of the animal during that 100ms window
